## Technologies

- HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript (ES6 Modules) — no build step, no external dependencies, system font stack
- Media Session API (lockscreen controls)
- Service Worker (cache and installation)
- Web App Manifest (PWA)
- Connection API (network quality detection, where supported)

### Service Worker caching strategies

- **Audio streams**: network-only, never cached (returns a controlled 503 when offline)
- **Static assets** (HTML, CSS, JS, icons): stale-while-revalidate, same-origin GET requests only
- **Navigation requests**: fall back to the cached `index.html` app shell when offline
- Cache is versioned via `CACHE_NAME` in `sw.js`: bump it whenever a static asset changes, otherwise users keep receiving stale files

## Local Development

To test locally, you need a local server (ES6 modules require HTTP):

```bash
# With Python
python3 -m http.server 8000

# With Ruby
ruby -run -ehttpd . -p8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000`

There are no automated tests: verify changes manually in the browser (playback, seeking, day navigation, offline behavior, PWA install).

## Conventions

- Code comments and documentation are written in English
- App version lives in `js/config.js` (`APP_VERSION`)
